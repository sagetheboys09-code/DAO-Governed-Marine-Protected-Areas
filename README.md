# 🌊 DAO-Governed Marine Protected Areas

Welcome to a revolutionary Web3 platform for sustainable ocean conservation! This project empowers communities to govern marine protected areas (MPAs) through decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) mechanisms on the Stacks blockchain. By leveraging blockchain transparency and incentives, we address real-world problems like overfishing, illegal poaching, and environmental degradation in marine ecosystems. Token holders vote on protection rules, while monitors earn rewards for reporting and verifying ocean health data.

## ✨ Features

🗳️ Community voting on MPA rules (e.g., fishing limits, no-take zones)
🏆 Token rewards for monitoring and reporting violations or ecosystem health
📜 Immutable ledger of rules, proposals, and monitoring reports
🔍 Transparent verification of reports via community or oracle integration
💰 Treasury management for funding rewards and conservation initiatives
🛡️ Staking mechanisms to ensure committed participation
🌍 Integration with real-world data (e.g., via oracles for satellite or sensor inputs)
🚫 Prevention of duplicate or fraudulent reports

## 🛠 How It Works

**For Community Members (Token Holders)**

- Acquire governance tokens to participate in the DAO.
- Submit proposals for new rules, such as designating protected zones or updating enforcement guidelines.
- Vote on active proposals using your staked tokens.
- Once a proposal passes, it's automatically executed, updating the rule book immutably.

**For Monitors**

- Stake tokens to become an eligible monitor.
- Submit monitoring reports (e.g., photos, GPS data, or sensor readings of marine conditions) via the platform.
- Reports are verified by the community or oracles—if approved, earn token rewards from the treasury.
- Track your rewards and contributions transparently.

**For Verifiers and Observers**

- Query the rule book to view current MPA regulations.
- Check monitoring reports and their verification status.
- Verify token ownership or staking for governance rights.

That's it! Decentralized governance ensures fair, transparent management of marine areas, incentivizing global participation in conservation.

## 📂 Smart Contracts

This project is built using Clarity on the Stacks blockchain and involves 8 smart contracts for robust functionality. Here's an overview:

1. **GovernanceToken.clar**: Implements a SIP-010 fungible token for DAO voting rights and rewards.
2. **DAOCore.clar**: Manages proposal creation, voting periods, and quorum checks for community decisions.
3. **ProposalExecutor.clar**: Automatically executes passed proposals, such as updating rules or distributing funds.
4. **RewardDistributor.clar**: Handles reward claims and distributions to verified monitors from the treasury.
5. **MonitoringRegistry.clar**: Registers and stores monitoring reports, preventing duplicates and enabling verification.
6. **RuleBook.clar**: Maintains an immutable record of active MPA rules, accessible for queries.
7. **Treasury.clar**: Manages funds (e.g., donations or grants) for rewards and operational costs, with DAO-controlled withdrawals.
8. **Staking.clar**: Allows users to stake tokens for monitoring eligibility or boosted voting power, with lock-up periods.

These contracts interact seamlessly to create a secure, decentralized system for marine conservation.
